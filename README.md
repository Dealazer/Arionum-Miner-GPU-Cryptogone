# Arionum GPU Miner, Cryptogone Edition #
GPU miner for [Arionum](https://www.arionum.com/)

This is a fork of [Guli's GPU miner](https://bitbucket.org/guli13/arionum-gpu-miner/src), adding windows support and some performance & stability improvements.

Please make sure you install latest Nvidia drivers if you use the CUDA miner !

## Updates

#### Version 1.5.0 alpha
* fixed important memory leak
* CPU blocks mining now working 
  (but still way slower than Bogdan's)
* more accurate hashrate computations 
  (the displayed hashrate will probably be a bit lower than before, but more exact)
* now correctly reports CPU/GPU hashrate too pools
* can set worker name via -i parameter (you can also set it via the run_CUDA/run_OpenCL scripts)

#### Version 1.4.0 (08/23/2018)
* block 80k fork support, only mines GPU blocks, idle during CPU ones
* Linux support
* see the [FAQ](https://bitbucket.org/cryptogone/arionum-gpu-miner/src/master/FAQ.md) for more info

#### Version 1.3.0 (07/11/2018)
* fixed more OpenCL issues
* switched to a single thread managing all GPUs (improves stability)
* can now set batch size & thread count per device, for example:
*  -d 0 -t 1 -b 6
*  -d 0,1,2 -t 1 -b 6
*  -d 0,1,2 -t 1,2,1 -b 6,3,6
* -k parameter removed
* updated README.md with information on how to get the most out of your GPU(s)

#### Version 1.2.0 (07/02/2018)
* fix OpenCL miner (kernel file was missing in release zip)
* -k parameter now also works for the OpenCL miner
* show error message and stack trace whenever a CUDA or OpenCL exception occurs (will help fixing future issues)

#### Version 1.1.0 (06/27/2018)
* fix CUDA multi gpu support (-d & -u parameters)
* add -k parameter, allows to specify a list of gpu devices to use, ex: -k 0,3,7
* show error message when out of memory during CUDA kernel creation

## Latest Binaries
If you do not want to compile the poject yourself, you can find up to date binaries at this address :

https://bitbucket.org/cryptogone/arionum-gpu-miner/downloads/

## Compilation guide
#### 1. (Windows) Install Visual Studio 2015 or 2017 (Community is sufficient)
Get it at https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/fr/vs/community/

If you install Visual Studio 2017 make sure you also install `Windows 8.1 SDK` (you can select it during the install)

#### 2. (Windows) Install CMake
Get it at https://cmake.org/download/
Make sure `cmake.exe` is in the system `PATH`

#### 3. Install CUDA
Get it at https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads (this also installs `OpenCL`)

#### 4. Install Git / Git console (Windows)
For Windows, get it at https://git-scm.com/download/win.

For Linux, `sudo apt-get install git`

**-- (Windows) All commands from here need to be run from a Git for Windows console --**

#### 5. Clone miner repository
    git clone https://bitbucket.org/cryptogone/arionum-gpu-miner.git
    cd arionum-gpu-miner
    
#### 6. Install dependencies 
Run **only one** of those, depending on your system

    ./setup_libs.sh vs2015
    ./setup_libs.sh vs2017
    ./setup_libs.sh linux

Note that on linux this will use `sudo` to call `apt-get` and so ask for your password for installing packages.

#### 7. Init & patch submodules
    ./setup_submodules.sh
    
#### 8. Generate project
Run **only one** of those, depending on your Visual Studio version

    ./gen_prj.sh vs2015
    ./gen_prj.sh vs2017
    ./gen_prj.sh linux
    
#### 9. Build
On Windows, open `arionum-gpu-miner.sln` with Visual Studio 2015 or 2017, then in the toolbar select `Release / x64` then `Build Menu -> Build Solution`.

You can also build from commandline: `./make_release_win.sh`

On Linux: `./make_release_linux.sh`.

## Starting the miner using sample scripts

Edit `run_OpenCL.bat` or `run_CUDA.bat` to your liking with Notepad, save and double click to launch.

On Linux same, but with `run_OpenCL.sh` or `run_CUDA.sh`.

See sections below for more information.

## Commandline Options

    -l, --list-devices                list all available devices and exit

## How to tune options for a good hahsrate

First check the list of compute devices on your system:

* For this, launch `listDevices_CUDA.bat/.sh` or `listDevices_OpenCL.bat/.sh`
* If you see no devices, it means that CUDA / OpenCL drivers are not properly installed or that there are no compatible GPU devices available

Now decide which GPU device(s) you want to use for mining

* Usually you want all devices, for that use -u parameter (miner will only use GPU devices, skipping CPU devices)
* If you want to only use specific devices, list them with -d parameter (ex: -d 0,3 mines only on devices 0 and 3)
* On laptops combinining a gaming GPU with an Integrated GPU, only mine on the gaming GPU (usually -d 0)

Choosing -b and -t:

* for **CUDA** it is recommended to use `-t 1`
* for **OpenCL** it is recommended to use `-t 2`
* for `-b` use an even value like 64, 96, 128, ... (higher value means better perf but more GPU memory used)
* Total GPU mem usage of the miner is ~= `nThreads * nBatches * 0.017 Gb`
* Usually, not all the memory is available to the miner, so you'll have to fiddle a bit to find the sweet spot for `-b`
* if mem usage (influenced by -b and -t) is too high, then miner will crash at launch or will produce bad shares

## Example -b / -t values

    AMD Vega64,          8GB, Win10, OpenCL => -t 2 -b 224
    NVIDIA GTX960,       4GB, Linux, CUDA   => -t 1 -b 224
    NVIDIA Quadro M500M, 2GB, Win10, CUDA   => -t 1 -b 96
